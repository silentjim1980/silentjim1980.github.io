Man it's been kind of a rough week here, the weather has been cold & we've gotten some snow. This week I've been busy with a few different projects, mainly noodling around in photoshop producing random images (be sure to check out my Instagram @silentjim1980, or see the main page).

I've been feeling kind of down as well, I attribute this to the media (social & mainstream), as it's been pretty rough for federal workers these days!  On a personal note I've been trying to be active on social media & by nature I'm not very social (humans in general are supposed to be social creatures so I'm told).  However when I try to step outside my comfort zone it (by nature is uncomfortable) to be the social & outgoing person that I would like to be, it's a Catch-22 situation.

As sort of a proper introduction I'd like to say welcome to the site / blog here!  I'll try to update it as much as possible with new content, which more than likely will be graphics of some kind.  The blog section of the site I will try to update on a weekly bases i.e. this post Issue #1.  Trying to update daily I don't think is realistic in my case, to many people I think are glued to social media, be it blogging, tweeting or posting on Instagram that I think they've forgotten what it means to be "In The Moment" instead of worrying about getting their content out there.

So in my case I feel that a weekly bases is enough as while I'm always trying to do something, it's just not content that I feel would be exciting enough to share with the world, I mean we all do laundry & dishes daily but most of us don't blog / tweet about right?

Enjoy the graphics! Be sure to check out my Instagram & or follow me on Twitter (promise I wont be one of those that tweets every second & you recieve a wall of tweets!).

I've also been experimenting with Github (as the site is hosted on it / here), I'm new to Github & using Jekyll (Markdown) format(s). In the past I've strictly worked with HTML or CMS options & it's been a while since I've worked with any web stuff & soooo out of the loop, there's HTML5 & CSS3 now!?

I've also been working with my Raspberry Pi's, I currently have 4 for various things...I like to tinker :wrench:  In fact I tinkered with installing the Linux Subsystem for Windows on my other PC & it did ***not*** like that.  Eventually I had to boot into safe mode & remove it to get the system back to it's normal state.

One of my Pi's I use as a network wide ad-blocker via [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/).  It's a really neat thing you can do with a Raspberry Pi, ***however*** if you only know enough about networking to get yourself into trouble like I do, it's not for the faint of heart.  I ran into an issue of updating the Pi-hole & enabling some features that broke my ability to cast from both my phone & PC to my TV's & had to spend over an hour tracking down & figuring out the issue.  I think I got it fix....I think...., only time will tell.  Running a home network with mutliple devices, routers & extenders makes me feel like this (one of my favorite comics):

That's all for this week folks, have a great weekend!
