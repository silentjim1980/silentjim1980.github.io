Wow, it's been almost a year since I posted on this. Lol, I sort of completely forgot about having the github site / blog.  I doubt anyone actually reads this or will unless you've found me via Twitter or Instagram.

So, since Feb. of last year a lot has happened in my life.  Sold our house, got a new vehicle, moved to a different state & had some serious life issue's which are currently ongoing.  I've not really thought about the "Website" or blog here until I was just randomly checking my Twitter & Instagram accounts.  Thought I would post this little update about what I have been up to & all that.

To recap, in May of last year we ended up selling our home & moving to another state.  Currently where we are I'm loving the people, atmosphere, pace of the lifestyle here.  I've been here 8 months & still finding, seeing new things but unfortunately not been able to unpack & set up the house the way I would like.  It's an ongoing problem just trying to unpack, sort & go through years of accumulated stuff.

Due to that & other priorities I've not had time or inclination to do any artwork / blog updates & in all likelyhood after this post I probably won't update for quite some time (if ever) because it's just not a priority right now & I lack the time to do it.

If you follow me on Twitter or Instagram you know that I don't update either very much at all, again priority takes precadent.  I do thank the people that follow me for doing so & appreciate it very much, you can follow/unfollow that's up to you.

Until next time,
SilentJim
