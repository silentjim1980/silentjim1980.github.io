Rare blog post here, again I doubt anyone actually reads this or will unless you've found me via Twitter or Instagram.

Due to other priorities I've rarely had time or inclination to do any artwork / blog updates. I keep this site up for the occaisional post here & there & try to add any of my thoughts or artwork that I deem worthy of enough to actually post.  That being said I'm considering redoing this site if time allow's for it, I'll possibly be adding new or removing old content & functions that apparently are no longer working on Github pages. In all likelyhood I'll be removing the Gallery / Portfolio section because I mainly use Instagram (link @ the bottom of the page) for showing new works (if any).

Twitter is mainly where I post thought's on anything these day's so the Blog section will more than likely be cut down to anything I wan't to expand on that's beyond Twitter's character limit.  This may or may not happen as my follow through on trying to get things done in the online world sometimes comes up short.  I just don't post any & everything about my life as people these days seem to want to do.

If you follow me on Twitter or Instagram you know that I don't update either very much at all, again priority takes precedent.  I do thank the people that follow me for doing so & appreciate it very much, you can follow/unfollow that's up to you.

Until next time,
SilentJim
