Another week, another week in review.  This week has brought bitter cold as half the U.S. knows & I've been touched by it probably a little more than others.
It's not been a very good week here, come to find out I didn't really have any heat!  I've been using small space heaters to heat the place to try & cut back on electricity use & with the bitter cold went to actually turn on the furnace only to find out it wasn't working! oops! 

However now that the weather is warming up for the most part I don't think it will be that much of an issue but it's definitely something that needs to be addressed as not sure if our air conditioner is in working condition either & spring / summer is just around the corner.

Also our vehicle has been acting up more lately, it's a 95 Ford, been ridden hard & put away wet one to many times I think & it's age is definitely starting to show.  It's just more hit of the many hits that have been coming lately & it's just not making things fun around here.

Like the Jay-Z song I got 99 problems & they all seem to want to occur at once around here.  So needless to say, things around here are just "Bleh" at the moment & not much in the way to report.
I've not felt much like doing anything other than sleeping (& have been) but sleeping poorly.  The weather changes I think are trying to make me sick & seem to be trying to come down with something.

I have been wanting to redo the website a little bit but am tore as to spending the time to do it.  It's only a place to post the occasional blog / update & showcase some of my graphics (which it does) & serves it's function but I want a little more "eye candy".  However with the template system currently in use it would require a little more time & effort put into it than I would like to spend on it, so it's a toss up of whether or not I'll actually do it.  I'm a firm believer in "If it's not broke, don't fix it" but the tinkerer in me just wants to keep tweaking & tweaking till it's juuuust right.

Till next weekend here's a song to start it off:
