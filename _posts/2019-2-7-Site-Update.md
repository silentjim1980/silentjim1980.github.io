So! If you've visited lately (or are seeing this) then you can tell I've rearranged some things here.  I decided to discontinue the use of the Instagram gallery as Instagram keeps breaking the API or my access token will break & no longer work.  I can't keep updating or renewing that every time it goes down so therefore I will no longer use it.

The portfolio or gallery that was here is now on it's own dedicated page /portfolio from this point on.  I've also moved the Helpful Things i.e. links to their own dedicated page as well & they are available there.

I want to keep the minimal look to the site & focus on just the content so the only pages that will be updated more than likely are this page, with blog post, the porfolio page & the links page.  The first two probably being updated more frequently than the links page but don't forget to check it every once in a while as will try to add more helpful links & items there as I remember or come across them.

I was seriously considering switching themes or changing the overall look of the site but this one has kind of grown on me as it's clean looking & just forces me to keep wanting to add more post or content to it rather than focusing on eye-candy.  In as much this it probably the way I will leave it & just update the previously mentioned pages.  I was hoping to just have a one page setup but it looks like that is not really an option.

Until the weekly update that's pretty much all there is for now & I'll post an update then.
