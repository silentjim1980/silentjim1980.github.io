So nothing much to report this week really, but I did make the small update to the website earlier in the week.  I've not really been making any new graphics as I've gotten a "creative mindeset" block going on.

I've not really felt up to doing much either, alhtough I did fool around with some "work at home" stuff.  Basically just a time waster, literally...It seems like majority of them are scams & or just take an absurdly amount of time to make a dollar or point or whatever it is to you need to turn in.

As it stands right now I'm not sure what my plans are for next week.  I don't really plan things out anymore, the phrase that comes to mind is "Man plans & God laughs", in short nothing much happened this week.

Until the next weekly update :wave:
