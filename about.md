Well, here it is: I'm on the PC a lot, I read, listen to music, play games (not so much anymore), I also do graphics work as a hobby. I've been graphics in some form as a hobby for years. I started out making forum signatures in Adobe Photoshop & gradually moved up to web site designing & everything else in between. These days I usually spend some time just making desktop wallpapers or Twitch.tv video overlays (I rarely stream these days) for friends or trick out my desktop with a new wallpaper / customization.  

I started this site as a place to showcase some of the things I've done for myself & various people. That being said I don't generally maintain it a lot, in truth I kind of forget I have it. However I do TRY to post my new works as often as I can when I remember to do it. I'm not much of a social media user, never have been probably never will be. I've did the whole Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Tumbler, Pintrest thing & I just really don't do a lot that I think is worth spending time to post on some social media site. I mean I'm interesting (who isn't) but I'm not THAT interesting.
